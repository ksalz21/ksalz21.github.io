My name is Kyle Salzman, and I'm a designer and fabricator living and working in New Orleans. For the last ten years I've been working in the entertainment industry, building scenery and props for Theatre, Film, and Live Entertainment. Check out some of my projects!

Entertainment is fun, but I'm also passionate about Functional Objects. I like to design and build useful, beautiful and durable things-things that people might want to have and use for the rest of their lives. Follow my on social media to see what I'm working on.
